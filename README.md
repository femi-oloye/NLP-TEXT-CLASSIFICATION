# Sentiment Analysis using Pretrained Transformers
## Project Overview

This project implements sentiment analysis using a pretrained Transformer model. The model classifies text reviews as positive or negative using the IMDB dataset. The entire workflow, including data preprocessing, training, and evaluation, was executed on Google Colab for efficiency.

## Technologies & Tools

- Python

- Hugging Face Transformers

- PyTorch

- Google Colab

- IMDB Dataset

## Model Performance

Accuracy      92.5%
Precision     91.8%
Recall        93.2%

This project was built using Hugging Face Transformers and the IMDB dataset. Special thanks to open-source contributor
